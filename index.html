  <h1>ELC Wellness App – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the ELC Wellness App, created for staff of Empowered Living Choices (ELC), handles information when you use its wellbeing tools and actions.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We process only the text you provide (e.g., “I feel stressed”). If you use an Action (such as boundary scripts), we use the input only to return the requested result.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Inputs are used to generate supportive responses. We do not sell or share your data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>Inputs remain within ChatGPT by default and are not stored by ELC. Sensitive details about clients, HR, or medical info should not be entered.</p>

  <h2>4. External Services</h2>
  <p>Some Actions may call external services to fulfil requests. Only the minimum data needed is sent.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the app at any time. If future versions introduce logs, you will have the right to request deletion.</p>
